Repository Created for Machine Learning Final project by GANESH PRASATH A


The AI TradeMaster  project introduces a comprehensive stock analysis dashboard designed to support real-time stock prediction and trading strategy development. By leveraging a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with over 77% prediction accuracy, the dashboard provides reliable insights for intraday and swing trading. The LSTM model processes historical stock data, capturing complex patterns in price trends, and has been optimized through rigorous backtesting, showing an impressive annual return of 30%.

  To enhance model predictions, the project integrates sentiment analysis, capturing market sentiment from news and social media to gauge investor mood and market psychology. Sentiment data serves as an additional input, allowing the model to consider external market factors in its predictions.
The dashboard also features essential technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands, widely used by traders to identify market trends and potential trading signals. These indicators provide additional layers of analysis, helping users make data-driven decisions based on momentum, volatility, and price strength.

  Built with a user-friendly GUI using Streamlit, AI TradeMaster allows users to visualize price trends, access real-time predictions, and review backtesting results all in one platform. The dashboard serves as a powerful decision-support tool for traders and investors, offering actionable insights to navigate the dynamic stock market effectively.
